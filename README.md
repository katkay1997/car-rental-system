                                Lux’s Car Rentals 
                    “When you rent from us, you’re renting Luxury” 


For this project, the collaborators and I are created a car rental system using the programming language C++.
With this project, users reserve a car in a seamless, simple process.
We will ask a few questions and users will get results quickly.
We will collect user data, ask users their price range, ask reservation dates and morning /afternoon times.

Afterward, the program will display a list of cars that are available during that time.
This project is created to help beginner programmers to understand the basic use of C++.
This project also shows the versatility of the C++ programming language.
This project also provides fresh ideas on how to customize one’s own car rental system project.
I have contributed to this project using a MacBook and the other collaborators contributed on PCs.
Make sure you have a compiler downloaded. You can use CLion (free for students), CodeBlocks, Visual Studio Code and more!
